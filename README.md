This greasemonkey script will only activate on the registerkey page. 

It assumes that you have been sent to the page and that the key field is already filled out.

It will automatically select the checkbox to accept the agreement, and then wait a second before clicking Continue.


To Install:

Navigate to the JS and view raw.
With GreaseMonkey, create a new user script an paste in the contents.

Apparently the github content is hosted as the wrong type, so it cannot auto-install by simply hitting the page. Oh well
